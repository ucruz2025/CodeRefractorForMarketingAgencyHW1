# CodeRefractorForMarketingAgencyHW1

## Small Descripition of Project
For this website, I took a client's existing HTML and CSS code and rewrote it so it followed the accessibility standards. Not only that but also so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## Steps for completing project
Some of the steps I did in order to complete this were:

    1. Scouted the HTML file making sure links worked appropriately

    2. Added alt texts for images so that the site followed accesibility standards

    3. Re-organized the HTML and CSS file so that they followed each other concurrently in a logical order

    4. Condensed and added descriptions within the CSS file for an easier read.
